Objective: For each plant species listed below, determine if it meets the core filtering criteria for the PlantCLEF 2025 Pyrenean/Mediterranean quadrat challenge. Provide simple Yes/No/Uncertain answers based on grounded search.

Species Batch [Insert Batch Number]:
1. Lactuca virosa L.
2. Crepis capillaris (L.) Wallr.
...
N. [Scientific Name N]

Required Determinations per Species:
a. Is Vascular Plant? (Yes/No/Uncertain based on classification like Angiosperm, Fern, etc.)
b. Is Quadrat Relevant? (Yes/No/Uncertain based on typical habit/size - e.g., herb, grass, small shrub, seedling, generally NOT large mature trees unless seedling form common in quadrats)
c. Is Present in Europe? (Yes/No/Uncertain based on native/naturalized range)
d. Is Present in Pyrenees/Mediterranean? (Yes/No/Uncertain based on specific regional distribution)

Output Format Instructions:
- Process each species sequentially. Start each entry with `## [Scientific Name]`.
- Under each species name, list the determinations clearly:
    * **Vascular:** [Yes/No/Uncertain]
    * **Quadrat Relevant:** [Yes/No/Uncertain]
    * **Europe Presence:** [Yes/No/Uncertain]
    * **Pyrenees/Med Presence:** [Yes/No/Uncertain]
- Provide only the Yes/No/Uncertain determination. Do not add extra justification unless absolutely necessary to clarify an 'Uncertain' answer very briefly.
- Use Markdown bold for labels (`**Label:**`).
- Use `---` as a clear separator between species entries.
