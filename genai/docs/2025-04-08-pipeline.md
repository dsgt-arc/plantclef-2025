PlantCLEF 2025 - Automated Species Identification Pipeline

High-Level Pipeline Overview:

This document outlines an automated pipeline designed to address the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge: identifying plant species within quadrat images, specifically focusing on Pyrenean and Mediterranean flora. The pipeline starts with a large list of potential species (~8000) and progressively filters and enriches this data through several stages using Gemini models. Stage 1 performs initial filtering based on relevance criteria using grounded search (Gemini 2.5 Pro) and structured output generation (Gemini 2.0 Flash). Stage 2 gathers detailed morphological and ecological data for the filtered species, again using Pro for search and Flash for structuring. Stage 3 analyzes potential co-occurrence patterns between species using grounded search informed by Stage 2 data. A preparatory Stage 3.5 then determines the specific habitat type for each plot using metadata and potentially images. Finally, Stage 4 uses Gemini 2.5 Pro's multimodal capabilities to analyze seasonal quadrat images for each plot, referencing the habitat-filtered and enriched species database (from Stages 1-3) to predict the species present, providing reasoning for each identification. The pipeline emphasizes batch processing and strategic model selection (Pro vs. Flash) for cost-effectiveness.

(Note for Teammates: The example prompts provided within each stage description below are illustrative starting points. They will require iterative testing and refinement based on observed performance and specific data characteristics to achieve optimal results.)

1.  Goal & Context:

    Objective: To automate the identification of all plant species present in high-resolution quadrat images (50x50cm vegetation plots) for the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge, focusing specifically on Pyrenean and Mediterranean flora.

    Challenge: Address the domain shift between single-plant training images and multi-species quadrat test images, and efficiently handle the initial large number of potential species (~8000) down to a relevant subset present in the plots.

2.  Model & Pricing Context:

    Models Used: This pipeline primarily utilizes Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0 Flash.

    Relative Pricing (Based on Provided Info):

        Gemini 2.5 Pro: Significantly more expensive, especially for output tokens and large prompts. Excels at complex reasoning, multimodal tasks, and benefits from Grounding via Google Search (per-request cost after free tier).

        Gemini 2.0 Flash: Considerably cheaper per token. A balanced, fast model suitable for structuring tasks, potentially less complex reasoning. Also supports Grounding.

    Pipeline Design Rationale:

        Uses Gemini 2.5 Pro for tasks requiring deep reasoning, synthesis from grounded search, and complex multimodal analysis (Stages 1-3 search, Stage 3.5 habitat determination, Stage 4 prediction).

        Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash for parsing semi-structured text (from Pro) and formatting it into strict JSON schemas (Stages 1-3 structuring). This step can potentially leverage the API's native structured output capabilities for increased reliability in generating the required JSON format.

        Crucially, the grounded search (using Pro) and the structured output generation (using Flash) are performed in separate steps for Stages 1-3 because current API capabilities likely do not allow using both Grounding via Google Search and native structured output enforcement within the same API request.

        Employs batching for grounded search calls (Stages 1-3) to minimize per-request grounding charges.

3.  Overall Strategy:

    A multi-stage pipeline designed to progressively filter species and enrich data using the Gemini models efficiently.

    Leverages Gemini 2.5 Pro (with Grounding where needed) for complex information retrieval, synthesis, and multimodal analysis.

    Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash (potentially with native structured output) for cost-effective structuring into predefined JSON schemas.

    Employs batch processing for applicable stages to optimize API costs.

    Generates structured, verifiable data at each stage.

    Includes a dedicated step (Stage 3.5) to determine plot habitat for better candidate species filtering before final prediction.

4.  Pipeline Stages:

    Stage 1: Initial Filtering

        Purpose: Rapidly reduce the initial ~8000 species list to candidates potentially relevant to Pyrenean/Mediterranean quadrats.

        Process:

            Batch the full species list.

            Use Gemini 2.5 Pro (Grounded) with a specific prompt to determine key filtering criteria per species.

            Use Gemini 2.0 Flash (with structured output if applicable) to parse the Pro output and create structured JSON.

            Filter the species list based on the JSON outputs.

        Output: A significantly reduced list of candidate species (~few hundred).

        Instructions:
        1. Examine all images (Image 1, 2, 3) for PLOT_123_Alpine.
        2. Identify species present using *only* scientific names from the Candidate Species Database provided above.
        3. Correlate visual evidence with the database information.
        4. Provide output as a JSON object adhering to the schema below.
        5. For each prediction, provide concise reasoning linking image evidence (mention image/season) to database info.

        Output JSON Schema:

5.  Key Technologies & Considerations:

    Models: Gemini 2.5 Pro (Grounded Search, Multimodal Analysis, Habitat Classification), Gemini 2.0 Flash (Structuring, potentially with native structured output).

    Techniques: Batch Processing, Grounded Search, Multimodal Input, Prompt Engineering, JSON Schema Validation, Context Filtering (Habitat-based), Habitat Classification.

    Cost Management: Addressed through batching, model selection per task, and habitat-based filtering before the expensive Stage 4 call.

    Challenges: Relies on grounding quality, habitat classification accuracy, requires careful prompt engineering and robust error handling, co-occurrence data may be sparse.

6.  Potential Experimentation & Variations (NEW):

    Reduced Prompting (Stage 4):

        Test providing less detailed information in the Stage 4 prompt's "Candidate Species Database". Instead of full summaries, try providing only:

            Scientific Name + Key Distinguishing Features + Habitat Type.

            Scientific Name + Growth Form + Flower Color/Season.

            Just the list of Scientific Names.

        Goal: Evaluate the trade-off between prompt token cost/complexity and the model's ability to leverage its internal knowledge alongside visual analysis.

    Visual-First / "Minimal Context" Prediction (Stage 4):

        Run Stage 4 providing only the images, dates, plot ID, determined habitat, and the list of candidate scientific names, omitting the detailed database summaries entirely.

        Goal: Assess how well Gemini 2.5 Pro performs identification based primarily on visual evidence and its internal knowledge, potentially offering significant cost savings if accuracy remains acceptable.

    Habitat Determination (Stage 3.5):

        Experiment with using only metadata (GPS, elevation, etc.) vs. metadata + images for habitat classification.

        Test using Gemini 2.0 Flash instead of Pro for this step if visual analysis proves less critical than metadata interpretation, potentially saving costs.

    Alternative Models: If necessary due to cost or performance, evaluate other available models (e.g., different Flash versions, future Pro versions) for specific pipeline stages.

    Structured Output Enforcement: Experiment extensively with the API's native structured output feature versus relying solely on prompt instructions for JSON generation in the Flash stages (1-3) to determine the most reliable method for your schemas.
